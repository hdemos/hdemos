## Hi there, I'm Haley ðŸ‘‹ :woman_technologist:

**hdemos/hdemos** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I'm an engineer-turned fullstack developer who is passionate about making technology more accessable, intuitive and clean. Between conquring startup and software challenges, I serve as a lead organizer for the DFW chaper of [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/). I am a bubbly generalist and quick learner. Starting my programming journey with Java, I learn new skills often, from Go and Kubernetes to improving my understanding of accessible website creation with React.
